# CloudedClicker V1.1.0

CloudedClicker is a lightweight, customizeable **autoclicker for Windows** - now with mouse macro recording and playback.

---

6 weeks ago, as of writing this, I experienced a serious distal humeral fracture (the lower part of your upper arm) that caused radial nerve palsy (nerve damage that causes you to lose control of your wrist and fingers). I then had surgery a week later to get it repaired, with my nerve found to be partially-severed (which was re-attached). Luckily for me, it was my dominant hand, meaning most things were significantly harder and tasks would slow to a crawl. However, during this time I figured I should try and write a project that could at least help minimise my strain (and play Cookie Clicker). Thus, CloudedClicker was born.
