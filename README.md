# ☁️ CloudedClicker V1.2.0

CloudedClicker is a lightweight, customizeable **autoclicker and macro tool for Windows** - now with full custom keybinds.

6 weeks ago, I suffered a serious distal humeral fracture, which resulted in radial nerve palsy - a condition that impairs my ability to control my wrist and fingers. After surgery, my nerve was found to be partially severed and surgically re-attached. As it was my dominant hand, everyday tasks became much more challenging and slow. During my recovery, I realized I could use this as an opportunity to create something that would reduce the strain I was experiencing (and play Cookie Clicker). Thus, CloudedClicker was born.
